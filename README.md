# Strategies for Testing Third Party Integrations

This repository is used for an exercise that explores the following strategies
for mocking third-party API calls:

* Stubbing the Network (using WebMock)
* Stubbing the Adapter
* Swapping out the Adapter

All implementations are kept in separate branches to ensure the main branch
provides a greenfield space for future groups.
